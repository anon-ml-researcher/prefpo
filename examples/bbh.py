"""BBH (BIG-Bench-Hard) example — uses built-in data loader and grader.

This is the simplest way to run PrefPO on a BBH task. The library provides
load_bbh() for data loading and get_bbh_grader() which auto-selects the right
grader (multiple choice, binary, or exact match) based on the task name.

BBH has 27 tasks across three types:
  - Multiple choice (e.g. disambiguation_qa, date_understanding)
  - Binary (e.g. sports_understanding, navigate, boolean_expressions)
  - Exact match (e.g. object_counting, word_sorting)

See prefpo/data/bbh.py for the full list of tasks and their types.
