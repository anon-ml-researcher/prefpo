"""GSM8K instruction-mode example — optimizes a math prompt with PrefPO.

Instruction mode optimizes a shared instruction that gets prepended to every
question in a dataset. The loop works like this:

  1. Sample two prompts from the pool
  2. Run both on the training questions via the task model (gpt-4o)
  3. A judge (gpt-5) compares the outputs and picks a winner + gives feedback
  4. An optimizer (gpt-5) rewrites the loser using the feedback
  5. Score the improved prompt on the validation set
  6. Add it to the pool and repeat

After all iterations, the best prompt is evaluated on a held-out test set.

To adapt this to your own task:
  - Swap load_gsm8k() for your own data loader that returns list[Sample]
  - Subclass Grader and implement grade() with your scoring logic
  - Adjust the config options (see inline comments below)
